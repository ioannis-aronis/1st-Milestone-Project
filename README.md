# ''**_Storyteller_** ''  https://ioannis-aronis.github.io/1st-Milestone-Project/index.html

## _**''An imaginary company's storytelling website creation''**_

My 1st Milestone Project from Code Academy's **_Full Stack Web Developer Program / Course_** 
, **_User Centric Front-End Development Module_** is about a static website that informs the potential visitors 
of an imaginary company and its founder (me) and gives some biographical information about the company and its creator,
places and businesses names that the company has been involved in projects there and with the specific businesses.
This way, the visitors of the site are given the opportunity to visit other pages that have to do with some of the the company's 
projects.

The cinstruction of the website (MS1) is a way to demoabilities of me as a junior web developer towards potential recruiters and employers 
who would like to hire my services as a junior web developer for a freelance project / contract or 
offer me a full-time job / position to their company's web development team.

I aimed to the creation of a website in which the **_storytelling_** of an Experienced Manager of the 
Tourist/Hospitality/Catering sector **_unfolds_** in a clear, simple and professional way.

Anyone who navigates to the webpages of the specific website is able to easily find the manager's 
contact details, the projects he has been involved and/or completed, his professional experience, 
the previous places he worked as well as each job's name, a brief job description in terms of duties 
per position, how long (duration) he stayed in each position. Also a completed CV to read or download in 
a .pdf file format.

Through the succesful completion of the 1st Milestone Project, whoever entered the above website 
at any given time should clearly recognise my abilities as a junior web developer.

Reasons that potential users / recruiters / employers may be entering the website, are the following:

* Users may wish to experience a demonstration of a front-end presentation of one of my projects, first hand.
* Users may wish to investigate and read through the HTML5, CSS3 and other potential libraries I used for completing this particular project.
* Users mau wish to understand and see my front-end design perception as a junior web developer.

# **UX**
A simple and clean design of a website that demonstrates my abilities on creating 
a professional website presentation for a professional / expert of another sector 
who wants to amplify his communication with new parnterships and display his work 
and experience in his sector.

It consists of 5 pages:
1. A **'home page'** that introduces the user who visit the website to the imaginary manager's projects with images, a brief descriptions and links to quality external videos or other websites. Additionally to the same home page by scrolling further down, the users will find a contact form that they can easily and directly fill it and contact the Manager.

2. A **'Contact'** page which allows the user to communicate with the imaginary manager so as to give them more information about him and his work or to send an offer or job proposal to him.

3. A **'Work'** page that allows the user to directly go and select links to watvh and read about the imaginary manager's portfolio / projects.

4. An **'About Me'** page that leads the user directly to a small BIO webpage about the imaginary manager.

5. A **'CV'** page that gives access to the user to information about the professional experience of the imaginary Manager.






# **User journey:**
1 The user begins at the **'Home'** page, firstly seeing the hero image of the imaginary manager smiling while workinmg on a project of his in his laptop. 
reading the information about what this website is about and what an eco home is.

                **IMAGE (LINK 1) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

2. Scrolling down to the next section of the home page where there are images and brief descriptions and links to 3 of the imaginary manager's projects. 
With the choice of clicking on the 'Read More' link / button on each one of the 3 projects or scrolling down to the next section.

                **IMAGE (LINK 2) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

3. At the next section of the home page is a contact form so as for the user to send his contact detaikls and request or write the subject he wishes the imaginary manager to contact himn for. Under this contact form there is a map with the address of the manager's office tagged on the map.

            **IMAGE (LINK 3) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

4. The website's links open in new tabs for the external websites, the video links play on the page or can go to full screen or be played on the YouTube website.

            **IMAGE (LINK 4) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

5. The second page is the **'Contact'** page, where there is a contact form for the users to fill in if they would like to contact the imaginary manager, know more information about his projects, or send other comments or messages to him. 

            **IMAGE (LINK 5) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

6. The third page is the **'Work'** page, where the users are directed to the imaginary manager's portfolio where they can click on links or go to another page by clicking on the navbar.

            **IMAGE (LINK 5) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

7. The fourth page is the **'About Me'** page, where the users can read a brief BIO of the imaginary manager or go to another page by clicking on the navbar.

            **IMAGE (LINK 5) MUST BE PUT HERE !!!!!**

*The users also can click on the **Linked In link or go to another page** by clicking on the navbar at all times despite of which page they are at any specific time.*





# **User stories:**
* As a user, I prefer **simple and elegant looking websites with clear subpages**.

* As a user, I prefer **an easy to learn navigation system / bar** in any website I visit. 
    
    The reasons for that is that I save a lot of time by trying to understand the navigation functions implemented in a website and I am not getting frustrated or lost because usually if I do or if I find out it is fuzzy and complex, I leave from the website, fast.

* As a user, I want to visit **web responsive websites** which literally translates to *''friendly and easy use and access in all devices formats, desktop, tablet or mobile.

* As a user, I want to create **''easy to use and easy to access''** find out what eco homes are.

* As a user, I want to **move to subwebpages of the website** rather fast and easy.

* As a user, I want to **watch a video of a project of the imaginary manager** to grasp an idea of his work.

* As a user, I want to find **more information about the imaginary manager's working history.**

The user’s goals can be met via this website as he interacts and uses a clear, simple and elegant web responsive website.

As this project (MS1) is basically my first project ever, it was important for me to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm a first-time user (and also myself with information not clearly coprehensive to me as a student yet).

With the navbar fixed on top, it is easy for users to navigate and be able to choose to go / move to another subwebpage of the same website wherever they are on the current page at any given time.

All links open into a new tab so the user will not forget *'Storyteller'* website and can go back to it very easy.





# **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes **(WIREFRAMES LINKS HERE!!!)** in desktop, tablet and phone view.






# **Features**
All five (5) pages consist of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the five (5) pages wherever you are on the current page. 

All five (5) pages also consist of the same social link taking the users to a new tab with the relevant social media of the imaginary manager's homepage as he is a fictional perosn and there are no social media accounts.

The five (5) pages also consist of the same footer with the imaginary manager's phone number and underneath is the copyright information.

The choice of the font called 'Open Sans' was made for consistency of the overall user experience and simplicity of appearance.

## **HERE THE COLOUR CHOICES OF THE ENTIRE WEBSITE AND CONTACT FORM MUST BE WRITTEN CORRECTLY**
*''The font colours of grey: rgb(69, 71, 69) form background colours in grey bg-secondary, button colours in green bg-success and social links in green: rgb(31, 160, 31) to link the Greener Homes to the colour green.''*






# **Home.html** (LINK TO WEBSITE'S HOME PAGE PUT HERE!!!)
This page under the navbar has a hero image of the imaginary manager, wearing a white T-shirt, smiling, while he is working at his laptop, taking notes, with a take-away coffee cup next to him. This image sends the user a sense of of familiarity with the imaginary manager and it inspires the user to feel somehow that this person is a friendly and potentialy looks like a person that the user ia a friend to. The name of the imaginary manager ‘IOANNIS ARONIS’ is displayed, underneath the hero image and under it the name of the website's purpose 'Storyteller''is making a statement of the reason this website was created for.

Next heading as the user scrolls down a little bit is ‘Projects’ which almost immediately leads the user to the core of the imaginary manager's professional description. That means What exactly he can do by showing off what he has done already in previous succesful management projects he was involved. 
Right after that section, three images of projects follow, each occuping a third of the screen's width. There is a brief title of each project and a link that when clicked it leads to another website or youtube video or a video is displayed on the same webpage the user is at.

Next follows a Moto phrase and under it a second phrase one that exmplains why that Moto phrase is there.

The next section is a 'CONTACT FORM' which consists of two (2) sub sections. Each sub section occupies 50% of the screens width.

The left sub section contains simple infromation of the imaginary manager such as the address of his office, his email and his phone number.

The right sub section contains the contact form's fields that the users must complete in order to contact and there after will be contacted by the imaginary manager.
The fields that need to be filled-in in the contact form are a Full Name field, an Email field, A Phone field, an Address field, A Subject field and a Text Input field.

Last but not least (to say the least) is a ‘Submit’ Button for the users to click once they have finished filling-in the contact form's fields. If the user clicks the button without completing all valid and/or necessary fields of the contact form, a message is displayed to fill in the appropriate field. When user hovers over the button it goes a lighter grey in colour.

Then there is the ‘Map’ section right under the contact form which informs the users of the imaginary manager's office web address, tagged on the map for a GPS easy input use. The ‘Map’ section occupies the entire width of the screen. 

At the bottom of the page is a grey container box that separates the webpage last section from the footer section, while showing a smooth colour-optical transition from contact form which appears to ''engulf'' the grey container box also occupies the entire width of the screen.

Just underneath in the footer section the phone of the imaginary manager is written and under that the copyright information is written.

# **Work.html** (LINK TO WEBSITE'S WORK PAGE PUT HERE!!!)
This page has also no hero image as well so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for, as well.

Instead it has the title 'PORTFOLIO OF WORK' centered under the navbar. Under this title, there are three words written and centered *'Past. Present. Future.'* that works as a statement for what the imaginary manager, has achieved in the past, what he does at present and the promise of what he will continue to do in the best way which only he can achieve, again.

Next section as the user scrolls down a little bit is a display of previous succesful management projects the imaginary manager was involved.

In the texts that follow the sections are splitted in the following way:
* one third (1/3) of the width of the screen is occupied from text with information such as the location of the business and under it the duration that the imaginary manager has been working there.
* two thirds (2/3) of the width of the screen are occupied from text with information such as the title / position  that the imaginary manager had in a business, under that title the name of the business and under that name will follow a brief description of the duties the imaginary manager had in the specific job and business.

## **Code** 
The code for my footer social links were copied from Code Institute source code for the resume project in the user centric frontend development module.

CI tutor helped me clarify what code to use for column sizes and directed me to W3 Schools to help with background image responsiveness. So I was able to make all the hero images on all three pages responsive.

Used code from CSS Tricks to help with font-size responsiveness.

Mentor shared a link from Stack Overflow to help rectify the white space on the right of the screen when in mobile phone view.


# **Acknowledgements**
I received inspiration for this project from when I created a webpage about eco homes and wanted to expand to make it a website.

Also thank you to the Code Institute slack channel, many CI tutors and mentor Precious Ijege.

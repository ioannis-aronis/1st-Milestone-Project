## _**''An imaginary consultancy company's website''**_

My 1st Milestone Project from Code Academy's **_Full Stack Web Developer Program / Course_** 
, **_User Centric Front-End Development Module_** is about a static website that informs the potential visitors 
of an imaginary consultancy company that is specialized in the hospitality and the catering sector as well as
its founder.

It provides them with biographical information for both the company and its founder, as well as 
the places and the clients / businesses names that the company has been involved in by deploying
 and completing projects there and with for the specific clients / businesses.

Also The visitors during their search in the website are given the opportunity to visit other pages
 that have to do with some of the ompany's projects.

This website is my actual first attempt in the world of code (MS1).
It is a presentation-1st attempt to implement what I have learned and understood so far from Code Institute's
 *HTML Essentials*, *CSS Essentials* and *User Centric Front-End Development* modules.

I aimed to the creation of a website in which the **_storytelling_** of an imaginary Experienced Manager and founder
 of his own company that undertakes projects in the Tourist/Hospitality/Catering sector **_unfolds_** in a clear and simple way.

Anyone who navigates to the webpages of the specific website is able to easily find contact details, 
the projects that the company has been involved and/or completed, the places the businesses - clients were based as well as their names

Therefore the visitors of the website should clearly grasp what the imaginary company does.

Reasons that potential users may be entering the website, are the following:

* Users may wish to experience a demonstration of a front-end presentation of one of my projects, first hand.
* Users may wish to investigate and read through the HTML5, CSS3 and other potential libraries I used for completing this particular project.
* Users may wish to understand and see my front-end design perception as a junior web developer.

# **UX**
A simple and clean design of a website that demonstrates my abilities on creating 
a website presentation for an imaginary company and its founder of another sector 
who wants to amplify his communication with new parnterships and display his work 
and experience in his sector.

It consists of 5 pages:
1. A **'home page'** that introduces the user who visit the website to 3 of the imaginary companny's projects each one with its logo images, 
   a brief description-moto and a link underneath that when clicked leads to their own websites. Additionally to the same home page by scrolling further down,
   the visitors / users will find a contact form that they can easily fill it and contact the imaginary company directly.

2. A **'Contact'** page which allows the user to immediately communicate with the imaginary company so as to give them more information of their needs 
   and / or send a job proposal to the company.

3. A **'Projects'** page that allows the visitor - user to directly visit the webpages of these completed projects selected from the imaginary companie's portfolio.
   A minimum display of 3 projects jigsahas been selected.

4. An **'About Us'** page that leads the user directly to a small BIO sub webpage about the imaginary company and its founder.

5. A **'Consultancy Services'** page that gives access to the visitor - user to information about previous projects that the imaginary company 
   has been involved in as well as what are the offered services the of imaginary company.

# **User stories:**
* As a user, I prefer **simple and elegant looking websites with clear subpages**.

* As a user, I prefer **an easy to learn navigation system / bar** in any website I visit. 
    
    The reasons for that is that I save a lot of time by trying to understand the navigation functions implemented in a website and I am not getting frustrated or lost because usually if I do or if I find out it is fuzzy and complex, I leave from the website, fast.

* As a user, I want to visit **web responsive websites** which literally translates to *''friendly and easy use and access in all devices formats, desktop, tablet or mobile.

* As a user, I want to visit **''easy to use and easy to access''** websites in terms of filling in information.

* As a user, I want to **move to subwebpages of the website** rather fast and easy.

* As a user, I want to **click on a link of a project of the imaginary company** to grasp an idea of their work.

* As a user, I want to find **more information about the imaginary company and its founder.**

The user’s goals can be met via this website as he interacts and uses a clear, simple and elegant web responsive website.

As this project (MS1) is basically my first project ever, it was important for me to keep it simple looking and in content too as to not overwhelm a first-time visitor - user (and also myself with information not clearly coprehensive to me, as a student, yet).

With the navbar fixed on top, it is easy for users to navigate and be able to choose to go / move to another subwebpage of the same website wherever they are on the current page at any given time.

All links open into a new tab so the user will not forget *'Storyteller'* website and can go back to it very easy by clikcing on iys own individual "tab" .





# **Wireframes**
I used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create wireframes **(WIREFRAMES .pdf LINKS HERE!!!)** in desktop, tablet and phone view.






# **Features**
All five (5) pages consist of a fixed navigation menu bar on top where you can click to go to any of the five (5) pages wherever you are on the current page. 

All five (5) pages also consist of the same social link taking the users to a new tab with the relevant social media of the imaginary manager's homepage as he is a fictional perosn and there are no social media accounts.

The five (5) pages also consist of the same footer with the imaginary manager's phone number and underneath is the copyright information.

The choice of the font called 'Open Sans' was made for consistency of the overall user experience and simplicity of appearance.

## **HERE THE COLOUR CHOICES OF THE ENTIRE WEBSITE AND CONTACT FORM MUST BE WRITTEN CORRECTLY**
*''The font colours of grey: rgb(69, 71, 69) form background colours in grey bg-secondary, button colours in green bg-success and social links in green: rgb(31, 160, 31) to link the Greener Homes to the colour green.''*






# **Home.html** (LINK TO WEBSITE'S HOME PAGE PUT HERE!!!)
This page under the navbar has a hero image of the imaginary manager, wearing a white T-shirt, smiling, while he is working at his laptop, taking notes, with a take-away coffee cup next to him. This image sends the user a sense of of familiarity with the imaginary manager and it inspires the user to feel somehow that this person is a friendly and potentialy looks like a person that the user ia a friend to. The name of the imaginary manager ‘IOANNIS ARONIS’ is displayed, underneath the hero image and under it the name of the website's purpose 'Storyteller''is making a statement of the reason this website was created for.

Next heading as the user scrolls down a little bit is ‘Projects’ which almost immediately leads the user to the core of the imaginary manager's professional description. That means What exactly he can do by showing off what he has done already in previous succesful management projects he was involved. 
Right after that section, three images of projects follow, each occuping a third of the screen's width. There is a brief title of each project and a link that when clicked it leads to another website or youtube video or a video is displayed on the same webpage the user is at.

Next follows a Moto phrase and under it a second phrase one that exmplains why that Moto phrase is there.

The next section is a 'CONTACT FORM' which consists of two (2) sub sections. Each sub section occupies 50% of the screens width.

The left sub section contains simple infromation of the imaginary manager such as the address of his office, his email and his phone number.

The right sub section contains the contact form's fields that the users must complete in order to contact and there after will be contacted by the imaginary manager.
The fields that need to be filled-in in the contact form are a Full Name field, an Email field, A Phone field, an Address field, A Subject field and a Text Input field.

Last but not least (to say the least) is a ‘Submit’ Button for the users to click once they have finished filling-in the contact form's fields. If the user clicks the button without completing all valid and/or necessary fields of the contact form, a message is displayed to fill in the appropriate field. When user hovers over the button it goes a lighter grey in colour.

Then there is the ‘Map’ section right under the contact form which informs the users of the imaginary manager's office web address, tagged on the map for a GPS easy input use. The ‘Map’ section occupies the entire width of the screen. 

At the bottom of the page is a grey container box that separates the webpage last section from the footer section, while showing a smooth colour-optical transition from contact form which appears to ''engulf'' the grey container box also occupies the entire width of the screen.

Just underneath in the footer section the phone of the imaginary manager is written and under that the copyright information is written.

# **Work.html** (LINK TO WEBSITE'S WORK PAGE PUT HERE!!!)
This page has also no hero image as well so as not to dιstract the user from the purpose it has been created for, as well.

Instead it has the title 'PORTFOLIO OF WORK' centered under the navbar. Under this title, there are three words written and centered *'Past. Present. Future.'* that works as a statement for what the imaginary manager, has achieved in the past, what he does at present and the promise of what he will continue to do in the best way which only he can achieve, again.

Next section as the user scrolls down a little bit is a display of previous succesful management projects the imaginary manager was involved.

In the texts that follow the sections are splitted in the following way:
* one third (1/3) of the width of the screen is occupied from text with information such as the location of the business and under it the duration that the imaginary manager has been working there.
* two thirds (2/3) of the width of the screen are occupied from text with information such as the title / position  that the imaginary manager had in a business, under that title the name of the business and under that name will follow a brief description of the duties the imaginary manager had in the specific job and business.

## **Code** 
The code for my footer social links were copied from Code Institute source code for the resume project in the user centric frontend development module.

CI tutor helped me clarify what code to use for column sizes and directed me to W3 Schools to help with background image responsiveness. So I was able to make all the hero images on all three pages responsive.

Used code from CSS Tricks to help with font-size responsiveness.

Mentor shared a link from Stack Overflow to help rectify the white space on the right of the screen when in mobile phone view.


# **Acknowledgements**
I received inspiration for this project from when I created a webpage about eco homes and wanted to expand to make it a website.

Also thank you to the Code Institute slack channel, many CI tutors and mentor Precious Ijege.
